Welcome to my academic and research website. I'm Shayan Jalali, a master's student in Medical Biotechnology at Università del Piemonte Orientale (UPO), Italy, and currently an Erasmus+ research intern at RCSI Dublin. I specialize in bioinformatics, computational modeling, and machine learning applications in cancer research, with over six years of international experience in both wet lab and computational biology settings.
- **I’m actively seeking PhD opportunities in computational biology, systems medicine, and AI-based biomedical research.**
